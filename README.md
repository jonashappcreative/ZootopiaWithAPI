Hi Maria, this is my code for Zootopia.

My only disclaimer, I somehow have a main and a master branch and have not figured our yet how to merge to the main only and delete the master, since locally the master seems to be the "main" and remote the "main" is the "main", if that makes sence. 
I skipped bonus tasks starting at "Skin Type". The Title Says Zootopia with API, but currently it's only the with GitHub version to be continued.
