Hi Maria, this is my code for Zootopia.

Edit:
Now the project also containes the API Part, requirements, gitignore and .env.
To run everything, install the requirements, add your API Key and in the terminal use

python3 animals_web_generator.py.

Inside Codio I face issues installing dotenv with pip... it works locally (as usual) - so I think this might be a codio issue? Can't test if project works online.

My only disclaimer, I somehow have a main and a master branch and have not figured our yet how to merge to the main only and delete the master, since locally the master seems to be the "main" and remote the "main" is the "main", if that makes sence. 
I skipped bonus tasks starting at "Skin Type". The Title Says Zootopia with API, but currently it's only the with GitHub version to be continued.
